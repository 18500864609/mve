/*
 * Routines for estimation of pose between two images.
 * Written by Simon Fuhrmann.
 *
 * The relation between two cameras is defined by the fundamental matrix.
 * In the calibrated case, where the camera internal parameters (focal
 * length, principal point) are known, pose can be described with the essential
 * matrix.
 *
 * The fundamental matrix can be computed from eight point correspondences
 * in the images, using the 8-point algorithm. It is also possible to compute
 * the fundamental matrix from seven point correspondences by enforcing
 * further constraints -- the 7-point algorithm.
 * If the camera calibration is know, the essential matrix can be computed
 * from as few as five point correspondences -- the 5-point algorithm.
 *
 * The input points to the N-point algorithms should be normalized such that
 * the mean of the points is zero and the points fit in the unit square. This
 * makes solving for the fundamental matrix numerically stable. The inverse
 * transformation can then applied afterwards. That is, for transformations
 * T1 and T2, the de-normalized fundamental matrix is given by F' = T2* F T1,
 * where T* is the transpose of T.
 *
 * Camera matrix can be extracted from the essential matrix as described
 * in [Sect 9.6.2, Hartley, Zisserman, 2004].
 *
 * Properties of the Fundamental matrix F:
 * - Rank 2 homogenous matrix with 7 degrees of freedom, det(F) = 0.
 * - Relates images points x, x' in two cameras: x'^T F x = 0.
 * - If F is the fundamental matrix for camera pair (P,P'), the transpose
 *   F^T is the fundamental matrix for camera pair (P',P).
 * - Two non-zero singular values.
 *
 * Properties of the Essential matrix E:
 * - Rank 2 homogenous matrix with 5 degrees of freedom, det(E) = 0.
 * - Relation to Fundamental matrix: E = K'^T F K.
 * - Relates normalized image points x, x' in two cameras: x'^T E x = 0.
 *   Normalized image point x := K^-1 x* with x* (unnormalized) image point.
 * - Two equal singular vales, the third one is zero.
